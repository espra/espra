# Guidelines for AI-Assisted Development

## Overview

**Project Name:** Espra.

**Description:** Espra is a new decentralized platform that combines an Onchain
UI Browser with a Hyperchain and a novel Common Economic Protocol.

## Repo Layout

This is a monorepo for the various aspects of Espra. Key top-level directories
are:

- `cmd/`

  - Each sub-directory of `cmd/` is a separate Rust binary crate corresponding
    to a single binary.

  - The package name must be the exact same as the sub-directory name.

- `doc/`

  - Houses any documentation relating to the project.

- `environ/`

  - Houses any scripts used to set up various environments.

- `lib/`

  - Each sub-directory is an internal Rust library crate corresponding to a
    single library.

  - The package name for the library is prefixed with `espra-`, but the crate is
    used through the rest of the code base without the prefix, and with hyphens
    replaced with underscores.

    For example, if there was a `font-parser` sub-directory within `lib/`, then
    its package name would be `espra-font-parser`, and it will be imported
    within the rest of the code base as:

    ```rust
    use font_parser;
    ```

Do not use plural words in any directory names within the repo.

## Cargo Workspaces

We use Cargo Workspaces to manage the different crates within the monorepo. The
root `Cargo.toml` file contains all of the dependencies specified in a single
place.

Each individual crate's `Cargo.toml` should specify the following:

```toml
[package]
name = "<package name>"
description = "<A concise description for the package>"
version = "<semver defaulting to 0.0.1>"
```

In addition, it should specify the following so that the corresponding fields
are inferred from the root `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
authors.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
exclude.workspace = true
homepage.workspace = true
include.workspace = true
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true
```

For binary crates, there should be a segment in the package's `Cargo.toml` that
specifies the `name` and `path` of the package binary, e.g. within
`cmd/chaos-client/Cargo.toml`, there should be lines stating:

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "chaos-client"
path = "chaos_client.rs"
```

For library crates, there should be a segment in the package's `Cargo.toml` that
specifies the `path` of the entry point for the library, e.g. within
`lib/font-parser/Cargo.toml`, there should be lines stating:

```toml
[lib]
path = "font_parser.rs"
```

The source files for a crate are stored directly within the specific
sub-directory for the crate. In this particular case, we do not follow the Rust
convention of storing the source files within an inner `src/` sub-directory.

Follow the above conventions when creating a new crate.

## Dependencies

Minimize the use of external dependencies so as to minimize the surface area for
supply chain attacks. When adding new external dependencies to the root
`Cargo.toml` for the Workspace, they should pin the version with an `=`, e.g.

```toml
syn = "=2.0.101"
```

## Tech Stack

Espra is primarily written in Rust:

- Unless stated otherwise, please follow idiomatic Rust practices and use the
  2024 edition.

- We are using the latest stable toolchain, i.e. Rust version 1.87+

Other key technologies include:

- `tokio` as the primary async runtime.

- `wgpu` for the WebGPU implementation.

- `winit` for windowing and related events.

## Documentation

The main README for the project is at `README.md`.

Each crate within `lib/` must have a `README.md` specific to that crate which
documents that crate. Please keep the associated `README.md` file updated as the
corresponding code changes.

When talking through the design and spec for a particular crate, or a set of
features in a crate, persist it within a `SPEC.md` file within the crate's
directory.

Keep `SPEC.md` updated, and if asked to break it down into smaller steps with
prompts for generating code, write the prompts for each step clearly into a
separate `TASKS.md` file within the same directory.

All other documentation should be kept in the top-level `doc/` directory, and
kept updated as the code base evolves.

## Coding Guidelines

- Provide clean, production-grade, high quality code.
- Use `clippy` and `rustfmt` conventions.
- Prefer `Result<T, E>` over panics for error handling.
- Use `Option` for nullable values.
- Document all public functions with Rustdoc comments.
- Avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary.
- End all comments with a period.
- Keep comments concise and understandable.
- Avoid unnecessary comments.
- Prefer explicit types in function signatures.
- Configuration is in `Cargo.toml` and `rustfmt.toml`.

## What to Avoid

- Do not suggest code that uses deprecated Rust features.

- Avoid non-idiomatic patterns (e.g., manual memory management).

- Do not generate code for files in `.gitignore`.

## Commits

We use the `git` version control system on a repo that is hosted on GitHub.

Once you've done what has been asked of you, ALWAYS create a git commit of the
changes that have been made. Commit messages must cover everything that has been
changed and staged, not just what you have done.

Commit messages must be of the form:

```
<area>: <one-line-summary>

<expanded-summary>
```

The `<area>` should reference the main directory in which the changes have been
made, e.g. `lib/cli`. The referenced directory must never be more than 4
directories deep, e.g. `lib` is okay, `lib/cli` is okay, but
`lib/cli/ui/component/spinner` is not okay.

If the main directory for the changes happens to be the root directory, i.e. the
top directory of the repo, then:

* If only one top-level file has been changed, use the name of the file, without
  any leading dots or trailing file extensions, e.g. `README` instead of
  `README.md`, `gitignore` instead of `.gitignore`, etc.

* If multiple files have been changed, then use `all` for `<area>`.

The `<one-line-summary>` should always be in lowercase, except for when
referencing any variable or type names or external projects. The total length of
the `<area>` and `<one-line-summary>` together must never exceed 66 bytes.

The first word of the `<one-line-summary>` must always be a verb, and the line
should convey the core essence of what has been changed in an informative, but
concise manner. The line should never end with a period or any other punctuation
mark.

The `<expanded-summary>` should elaborate on what has been changed so that it is
useful for anyone who might be looking at it to help fix any issues that might
have arisen.

The summary must be properly punctuated, and reflowed so that no line of the
`<expanded-summary>` exceeds 73 bytes.

Here are some examples of how commit messages should look:

```
cmd/trace: handle Sync event at the beginning of the trace

Currently the code assumes that there's no Sync event at the start of
the trace, but this hasn't been correct for some time. Count Syncs and
look for at least one instead of looking for zero.
```

```
cmd/internal/obj/s390x: fix potential recursive String call

This String method can potentially recurse infinitely, since %#x will
apparently call String if the method exists. This isn't well documented,
but cmd/vet will be updated soon to check this (when we update the
vendored x/tools dependency) so cut off the recursion by converting to
the underlying type first.
```

```
crypto/tls: reject duplicate TLS 1.3 EncryptedExtensions

When a TLS 1.3 client processes the server's encryptedExtensionsMsg it
should reject instances that contain duplicate extension types.

RFC 8446 ยง4.2 says:
  There MUST NOT be more than one extension of the same type in a given
  extension block.

This update matches enforcement done in the client hello unmarshalling,
but applied to the TLS 1.3 encrypted extensions message unmarshalling.
```

Commits MUST NOT include any lines referencing the AI assisted tools that have
been used, i.e. there should be no lines like `Generated with` or
`Co-Authored-By`.

## Testing

All of the code should be well tested, so as to maximize testing coverage across
the code base.

However, do not go overboard in creating lots of unnecessary tests. Tests should
be comprehensive, but minimal.

Use simple but descriptive names for test function names. Avoid prefixing these
function names with `test_`.

When importing the crate that is being tested, make sure to reference it by its
actual package name, with hyphens converted to underscores, but alias it to the
name that will be used in the rest of the code base.

For example, within `lib/espra-cli/tests/some_test.rs`, import the crate as:

```rust
use espra_cli as cli;
```

Tests must be kept within `tests` sub-directories of packages. The names of
files within this directory must end with a `_test.rs` suffix. All tests must be
at the top-level of these files, and not within any inner modules.

Similarly, any examples must be within an `examples` sub-directory and
benchmarks must be within a `benches` sub-directory.

Always test relevant changes after updating any code.
